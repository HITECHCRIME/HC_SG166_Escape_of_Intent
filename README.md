## Lyrics

```
they're aiming for the tears through corridors of veins 
pulsing out your name in braille bursting through the pain
call it what it is

all the seers twisting tales world listening to them like they're real
stay true to what mind is hinting, asserting/setting goals for yourself
i know coz i'm feeling what they make you feel
i know coz i'm feeling what they make you feel
make you feel, coz they make you feel aye

praise for the living i'll say not
"create for the breathing ones" she say it for the love
praise for the living i'll say not
"create for the breathing ones" she say it for the love

```
